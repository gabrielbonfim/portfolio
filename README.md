# Portfolio
For this project, IÂ´m building a portfolio website. It was provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and I replicated that design in HTML and CSS. I developed a responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects I will complete through the course of the Nanodegree program.
